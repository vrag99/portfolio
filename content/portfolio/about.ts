I’m a 3rd year ECE student at IIT Roorkee, and I love to *make and break stuff*. My engineering interests span across the entire stack – from building user interfaces to diving deep into kernel systems. I’ve worked on diverse projects ranging from complex frontend systems to building my own container runtime. Besides this, I like to try out ctfs sometimes.
